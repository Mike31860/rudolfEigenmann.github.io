abstract = {We present best practices for professionals who support computational and data-intensive (CDI) research projects. The practices resulted from the Xpert Network activities, an initiative that brings together major NSF-funded projects for advanced cyberinfrastructure, national projects, and university teams that include individuals or groups of such professionals. Additionally, our recommendations are based on years of experience building multidisciplinary applications and teaching computing to scientists. This paper focuses particularly on practices that differ from those in a general software engineering context. This paper also describes the Xpert Network initiative where participants exchange best practices, tools, successes, challenges, and general information about their activities, leading to increased productivity, efficiency, and coordination in the ever-growing community of scientists that use computational and data-intensive research methods.},
