        I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate and Research Assistant at the University of Delaware, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

        I have always loved learning, growing, developing, and challenging myself to contribute to something significant. The whole point of learning more is to be able to make a difference in the world. My purpose is to help the world run better.

<h2>Research Topic: iCetus, An Interactive Parallelizing Compiler</h2>

    <b>Project Description: </b> Today’s computers are all multicore. In a modern shared-memory architecture, parallelization techniques enable us to utilize multiple processors simultaneously and improve the performance of an application by converting sequential code into multi-threaded and/or vectorized code. 

Our goal is to develop a tool that allows users with varying skill sets to apply parallelization techniques interactively.

    </div>

</div>

<div class="grid-container">
 <div class="grid-item">
 While the tool can parallelize the code/ parts of the code in a fully automatic format for Non-expert users,  Power users can finely steer the optimization process through the tool menus to obtain an optimized version of the code.

<h2>Research Topic: Subscripted subscript patterns</h2>

    <div class="grid-item">
    <b>Project Description: </b> A number of scientific applications comprise of loops wherein an array is subscripted by another array - a[b[i]]. With write references to the host array (array ‘a’) within a loop, current compile-time techniques are incapable of detecting such loops as parallelizable. If left unparallelized, these loops can in-turn prevent the performance obtained through automatic parallelization, matching that of the hand parallelized version. Hence, Subscripted subscript analysis is the next big challenge in Automatic Parallelization.

    <b>Project Description: </b> Achieving high performance on today’s proces-
sors relies on the different compiler optimizations. Determining what optimizations to apply and where depends on the program and the target platform. Additionally, the different set of optimizations will create a huge optimization space, where each of the optimizations can provide good performance individually, and when combined they could increase or degrade performance. In other words, choosing the best set of optimizations will maximize the performance of a target application

    <b>Project Description: </b> Loop blocking (tiling) is a well-known compiler optimization that helps improve cache performance by dividing the loop iteration space into smaller blocks (tiles); reuse of array elements within each tile is maximized by ensuring that the working set for the tile fits into the data cache.
